Change Log
================================================================================
1.5.05    28/08/2022   
* FIX: Lines wrapped onto a new line as a result of indentation, were causing
       the following line to be converted incorrectly.
* FIX: '@' and '#' characters removed from variable names to aid compilation on
       machines using code pages which do not support them (ticket #32).
* FIX: Definition of CVTRGPLOG was not allowing the program to compile properly.
================================================================================
1.5.04    01/04/2022   
* FIX: Constant definitions with a name using an elipsis when not required 
       caused a program crash.
* FIX: Conversion of mixed source where mainline starts with /free was placing
       moved definitions prior to the first line of mainline code.

* FIX: (Ticket #38) Ensure that strcutre closing opcodes are in the requested
       case.
* FIX: (Ticket #39) Correct the conversion of EXTNAME keyword containing extract
       type.

* FIX: (Ticket #34) CHECKR not converting properly.
* FIX: (Ticket #35) Testing of presence of reserved word *ROUTINE in status 
       data structure was not taking lower-case into account.
================================================================================
1.5.02    18/12/2021   
* FIX: MOVEA with an index variable name of more than 3 characters was being
       converted incorrectly, causing a compilation error.
================================================================================
1.5.01    02/12/2021   
* NEW: Extended indentation logic to include declarations, to match that of RDi.
* NEW: Reinstated wrapping of code lines which extend into comment area in order
       to preserve correct indentation as much as possible.
* FIX: Push copybook definition outside of data strucutres by default (ticket 
       #31).
* FIX: Convert conversion of pointer parameters in prototype definitions which
       have no name (ticket #30).
* FIX: Avoid truncation of long H-specs (ticket #29).
* FIX: Structure long name (with elipsis) following another structure were being
       converted incorrectly.
================================================================================
1.5.00    03/11/2021   
* NEW: Source members of type 'RPG' are converted to RPGLE prior to being run
       through CVTRPGFREE.
* NEW: Logging option added.  Conversions are now logged to file QGPL/CVTRPGLOG.
* NEW: Warning added for files which cannot be found during conversion.
* NEW: CAT now converts if no padding specified and sum lengths of fields 
       matches or exceeds the result field.
* NEW: Constants are catalogued to make MOVEs which use them convert reliably.
* NEW: Conversion of MOVE statements has been improved, resulting in a more
       accurate functional conversion, leaving fewer lines required to be 
       manually amended to produce a clean compile.
* NEW: Move of inline definitions now excludes variables already defined,
       resulting in fewer 'already defined' compilation errors.
* NEW: Fields defined on I-specs are added to the dictionary to improve convers-
       ion of MOVEs.
* FIX: CAT(P) conversion now pads the result correctly.
* FIX: Stand-alone fields were not having their domains catalogued correctly in
       a number of instances, leading to non-conversion of some moves.
* FIX: Multi-line ELSEIF was not being converted.
* FIX: Coversion of multiple members was producing a spool file for each member.
       It now puts all conversions onto a single spool file.
* FIX: /copy following a structure definition was sometimes being included in
       the definition instead of outside of it.
* FIX: MOVE(P) and MOVEL(P) conversion where a char result field is the same
       length or shorter than the factor2 field no longer performs the redundant
       padding.

================================================================================
1.4.0     24/10/2021   
* NOTE THE SOURCE TYPE FOR CVTRPGFRER HAS CHANGED TO SQLRPGLE !!
* NEW: Field definitions for files are retrieved and used to determine whether a
       MOVE is safe to convert (requires files to be in the library list).
       This has pushed the average conversion rate to over 98% in most cases.
       This required the inclusion of embedded SQL and so now requires V7R2M0 or
       higher.  Included:
       > Alpha to Alpha same length.
       > Alpha to Alpha, target longer than source.
       > Alpha to Numeric, same length.
       > Numeric to Alpha, same length.
       More to follow...
* FIX: Conversion of ElseIf was truncating extended factor2.
* FIX: MOVE involving *ALL now converts.
* FIX: CALL with an extender or error indicator now convert to CALLP(E) and
       sets any associated error indicator.

       conversion.
* FIX: LDA datastructure defined as UDS now converts to DTAARA(*AUTO) without
       enclosing apostophes (ticket #22).
* FIX: Error indicator on most opcodes was not being converted to using the (E)
       operation extender.
* FIX: MOVE(P) and MOVEL(P) were not converted so that the target field is
       cleared first.

* FIX: Corrected the conversion of CALLB.

================================================================================

       one during conversion to avoid generating a conversion error.
* FIX: Amended to allow compilation of the main program under V7R1M0.

================================================================================
1.3.3     10/02/2021     

* FIX: Embedded SQL on C-specs were being treated as having conditioning
       indicators, resulting in non-conversion.  This has been fixed.
* FIX: Conversion of DS omitted the last subfield if the sibfield was hte last
       line of source.
* FIX: DO statements without from and to values were missing the default 'to' on

       errors.
* FIX: D-specs with DTAARA(*VAR are now expanded properly.
* FIX: Removal of non-printable characters now extends to the line marker part
       of the line.  This removes some formatting issues encountered.

1.3.0     12/10/2020     

* NEW: Parameter lists can now be converted and used to define procedure
       interfaces (i.e. replace *ENTRY), prototypes (i.e. programs called via
       CALL statements and CALLP parameters.
* NEW: CALL opcodes are now converted to CALLP if conversion of parameter lists
       is requested.

* FIX: Corrected the extraction and conversion of TAG statements.
* FIX: D-specs with data type Z are now converted to Timestamp correctly.
* FIX: DOU statements are now converted (don't know how I missed that one!).
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

       %time();
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.2.3     27/07/2020     

* NEW: Added option to remove non-printable characters from comments.
       Much old source contains non-printable characters in order to apply colours
       and highlighting to lines of code - usually comments, and these are no longer
       required when using the LPEX editor.  So an option has been added to remove
       these characters from the source.
* Fix: when moving in-line declarations, trailing characters from CALLP operators
       would sometimes be interpeested as being a declaration.  This has been fixed.

* CHG: Replaced '$' in all variable names as this was causing compilation issues on
       some codepages.
* FIX: Copybooks containing structure definitions without an additional line after
       the last definition were missing the 'End-' declaration on conversion.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1.1.4     13/01/2017     

* FIX: Conversion of Prototypes or Procedure Interfaces which happen to have a 'U'
       or 'S' in position 23 caused the generation of an erroneous DTAARA keyword.
* FIX: EXTPROC with a name that spans more than one line now moves the remaining 
       name to the left of the line as expected.
* FIX: Timestamps (Data Type 'Z') now correctly omit the '()' definition on 
       conversion.
* FIX: Stand-alone fields with data types that have no brackets (e.g. Ind) now 
       have a space inserted before the keywords for the field.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.1.3     24/11/2016     

* FIX: Conversion of D-specs with keywords and comments on the same line could
       corrupt the keywords if the conversion would cause them to encroach upon the
       comment section.  This has been fixed, and the offending keyword(s) are now
       moved to a secondary line.
* FIX: the dropping of DATFMT and TIMFMT values from variable definitions.
* FIX: Stopped the extraneous space being inserted prior to the terminating 
       semi-colon when no keywords are specified on a definition.

       moved to the left of the line.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.1.0     15/11/2016     

* NEW: Changed command to allow it to be used on 80-column RPG source files as 
       well as 100-column source files.
* NEW: Command now uses temporary source files in QTEMP.
